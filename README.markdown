## Features

1. Prospective Employee Entry
2. Employee Submissions Search
3. See ``./meetings/.business.requirements.md``.

The basic problem is solved through WordPress’s default taxonomy over Posts 
and Pages. Users who log in will review:

1. Job [Post]ings
2. Employees — a rich concept with many navigational properties like  
   [prospective] or [hasProfileCreated] or [hasPremiumCredit] (probably) via 
   Stripe Subscription Authorization wrappers via AngularJS.
3. Recruiters — will be able to interact with Employees, but can only search 
   or read from their list views and detail views (Profile Pages, assuming 
   a distinction through filters of “Registered” and “Unregistered”).
4. Managers — managers, which will be a type of Administrator, will be able 
   to create Recruiters and Employees, yet Job Postings will be irrelevant 
   to their daily workflows.
