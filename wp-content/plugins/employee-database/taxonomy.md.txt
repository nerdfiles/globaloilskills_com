       AngularJS  
       I've already implemented AngularJS: one controller, two services, two 
       directives. WordPress Roles are being used to authorize data services, 
       and we use AngularJS's internal $http service with Promises to size and 
       shape payloads to clients.

7. Testing
See https://github.com/nerdfiles/skreen.ls/blob/develop/shoot.site.coffee.

"Don't commit a line of code unless and until you have one failing test for its logical feature." But the (kind of test)[1-4] is determined by the [feature scope] which is composed of logical units or [modules of code].

1. Test-driven Development: Restricted Unit Testing (around API Requests and Responses)
1.1. frex: /api/v1/data/endpoint, /api/v2/search?query={{term}}
2. Behavior-driven Development: Behavior Testing (around Specific Interactions)
2.1. frex: Button clicks, Swipes, etc.
3. Integration Testing (around Modular Units of Programmatic Code)
3.1. frex: Search Bar, Navigation, etc.
4. Feature/Subbranch Development: End-to-End Testing (around Use Case Flows)
4.1. frex: Pages for Login Flow, Sidebars for Upload, etc.
5. UX Development: Automated Screen Testing (around Design Goals expressed as Modular Units of Presentation Code)
5.1. frex: Design Borders, Sprites, Icons, Typesetting, etc.
6. Generational Development: Regression Testing based on Client-side Error Analytics (emissions of errors from clients to a "regression API" that listens for generated errors)
6.1. frex: https://airbrake.io/blog/notifier/state-client-side-javascript-error-reporting combined with Screen Tests for Spotting errors
7. Validation: 
7.1. Semantics — http://linter.structured-data.org
7.2. Markup and CSS — http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/
8. Code Linting: JSHint for Programmatic Front End syntax checking, use Preprocessors where possible to oversee correct/proper syntax production
9. Device/Browser/Responsive Testing:
9.1 Use third-party services like Sauce Labs or Browser Stack, who offer automation especially with tools like AngularJS's Protractor which can be used [outside of the Angular context]
9.2 Automated: Use Vagrant Cookbooks to build recipes for certain configurations
9.3 Manual Testing: Virtual Environments for various Use Case flows that are of interest to Users, Customers, and Stakeholders

Software Development Life Cycle configuration files should follow: 

1. Unit (local, development)
2. Behavior (local, development)
3. Integration (development, staging)
4. Feature (staging, QA)
5. Screen (QA, production)

Environments: 

1. Local
2. Development
3. Staging
4. QA
5. Production
